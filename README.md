# Wallet Manager Application

## Description

The Wallet Manager Application is designed to efficiently manage a wallet's contents on CLI, allowing users to seamlessly add and remove various items from their wallet. The application categorizes items based on their size, dividing the wallet into compartments for SMALL, MEDIUM, and LARGE items. Each item type, such as ID cards, Money, Bank Cards, Driver Licenses, Visitor Cards, and ID Photos, is assigned a specific size.

For instance, a Bank Card is categorized as MEDIUM_AND_THICK, indicating that it belongs to the MEDIUM compartment and occupies two slots due to its thickness. Some items, like ID cards and Driver's Licenses, are unique, while others, like Money, Visitor Cards, and ID Photos, can exist in multiple quantities.
